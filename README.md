# ChicThreads
This repository contains the source code for the ChicThreads ecommerce website, which is designed to be intelligent and user-friendly. Using the DOM, the website features specific functionalities as outlined below:

Shop window - where product cards and all their information are displayed.
Products - all product cards are dynamically created and assigned to the shop window using the DOM. The cards display the product title, photo, description, price, and a functional "Add to Cart" button.
Shopping cart - customers can add and remove products from the cart via the DOM. The cart displays the total number of items and the total purchase value. When the cart is empty, the message "Cart is Empty" is rendered.
Navigation bar - products in the shop window are filtered according to the clicked filter on the header, starting with "All" by default. For example, when the "Pants" filter is clicked, only products with the "Pants" tag are displayed in the shop window. When the "Shirts" filter is clicked, only products with the "Shirts" tag are displayed in the shop window.
Search bar - products in the shop window are filtered according to the term typed in the search bar. For example, when "Black Hat" is typed, only products with "Black Hat" in the name are displayed in the shop window. When "Shirt" is typed, only products with "Shirt" in the name are displayed in the shop window.

This source code can be used to create a functional and intelligent ecommerce website for ChicThreads, with a dynamic shop window and intuitive navigation for customers.
